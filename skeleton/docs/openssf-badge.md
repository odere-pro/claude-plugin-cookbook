# OpenSSF Best Practices — self-assessment

The [OpenSSF Best Practices badge](https://www.bestpractices.dev/) is a self-assessment against an open
checklist. Register the repo to get a numeric project id, then add the (currently commented) badge to
[`../README.md`](../README.md) with that id. Keep the evidence here so the answers stay reviewable.
